# Quantum Machine Learning: The Future of Artificial Intelligence

🎓 Presented by **Revanth Reddy Kanubaddi**  
📍 At the **Student Arts & Research Symposium (StARS)**  
🏫 **Bridgewater State University**  
📅 **April 30, 2025**  
🧠 With guidance from **Prof. Edward Deveny**



## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the presentation slides from my talk on **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)**—delivered at Bridgewater State University's **Student Arts & Research Symposium (StARS)**. The presentation was designed to make cutting-edge concepts in quantum computing and AI accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.


## 🎯 Presentation Goals

- Introduce **Quantum Computing** and its fundamental principles
- Explain **why traditional Machine Learning is hitting limitations**
- Explore how **Quantum Machine Learning** offers new computational possibilities
- Showcase **real-world applications** such as cancer detection, climate science, and finance
- Demonstrate a **research project comparing Classical ML vs QML** for breast cancer detection



## 🧪 Key Topics Covered

- **Classical vs Quantum Computing**  
- **Superposition, Entanglement, Interference**  
- **Why Combine Quantum with ML?**  
- **Challenges in Classical ML: Big Data, Optimization, Complexity**  
- **Exponential Speedup through QML**  
- **Hybrid Systems: Quantum + Classical**  
- **Current Challenges (Hardware, Noise, Scalability)**  
- **The Million-Qubit Dream and NISQ Era**  



## 🧬 Real-World Use Cases for QML

- **🧪 Medicine**: Personalized cancer treatment
- **🌎 Climate Science**: Designing materials for carbon capture
- **💰 Finance**: Secure fraud detection & quantum encryption
- **🤖 AI**: Smarter models that require less training data



## 🧠 Research Highlight
